    <h1> Alex Green's Biography</h1>

    <p>At 21 I started my career in IT but my experience started back in the elementary school. My eldest brother owned a computer repair business (most operations were in the house) and that's where most of my fundamental knowledge about computers began. This sparked my facination around <strong>technology, business, and learning</strong>. For a while, I thought about getting into Robotics and believed the only way to be part of that is by becoming a Mechanical or Electrical Engineer. Not only was I completely wrong but this led me to finmd my new calling</p>

    <p>Starting my engineering expereince in 2018-2019, I volunteered for the NASA Apollo 50th Anniversary Robotics Competition. During that timne I met a great student, who is now a developer for Home Depot, who was focusing on IT. He was the only non-family person to show me the oppurtunities available in Tech. After 2021 I changed careers  to IT and worked with and for some great people. </p>

    <p>I have worked with Syracuse University, Delloitte, DOD, NFL, Motorolla, Apple, and more companies.</p>
